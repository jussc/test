          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>I am committed to helping adolescents manage their feelings in healthier ways. Whether it be bullying, academic pressure or difficulty establishing friendships, the teenage years can be some of the most stressful. Having said this, I believe in a child's resilience. While a part of them may be hurt or in pain, they also possess the inner wisdom and creativity to overcome. My goal is to help children and adolescents discover and accept who they are because only in doing so will they learn to let go and move forward.</p>
          <p>
          I specialize in <strong>sand play</strong> and journal therapy and have had extensive training in both. I have seen its benefits particularly for children diagnosed with Asperger's. I work very well with boys who are experiencing social anxiety, poor anger management and relational conflict with their parents.</p>
          <p>I have worked in the mental health community for 10 years and have gained tremendous experience from my work with children and families. I am passionate about supporting parents having a difficult time with parenting or relating with their children. I look forward to partnering with you. </p>
